## Introduction

This Power BI project enables comprehensive analysis of family expenses by consolidating data from multiple sources, including CSV and XLSX files from different bank accounts. The report offers insights into account balances, income, expenses, and investment developments over time.

## Purpose of the Project

This Power BI project was created for educational purposes to demonstrate data visualization techniques in Power BI. All the data presented in the charts represent synthetic financial transactions and is in Danish Krone (DKK) unless indicated otherwise. 

## Features

- **Overview Dashboard:** Provides a summary of account balances, income, and expenses across all accounts.
  
- **Account Balance Distribution:** Visualizes the distribution of account balances for pension, current, investment, and savings accounts.

- **Income and Expenses Analysis:** Offers insights into income and expenses distribution over different time periods.

- **Pension and Investment Tracking:** Tracks the performance and development of pension funds and investments over time.

## Data Sources

The project consolidates data from CSV and XLSX files representing transactions from different bank accounts. New files can be easily integrated to include additional transactions.
